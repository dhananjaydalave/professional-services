# ZetaSQL Helper

This project is currently a work in progress that will provide tools for
performing query analysis on BigQuery using
[ZetaSQL](./zetasql-toolkit-core).

It currently includes the [ZetaSQL Toolkit](./zetasql-toolkit-core); a library
that helps users use ZetaSQL's Java API to perform SQL analysis for multiple
query engines, including BigQuery.
